# Movie Query

 Simple Project for querying Movies from tMDB


## Development
I use live server to serve the website, you can install that locally or globally, it's included in package.json. You have to use a server because I chose to use esmodules which is supported in every main browser except IE (but IE is/should be deprecated)
`npm run develop` to start the live-server on port 8080, http://localhost:8080/src

## Testing
`npm run watch` to trigger UVU to watch the folders and execute tests on any change
`npm run test` to just run the tests once
